## About

This is a dynamic weather app that allows users to get the latest weather information based either on their current location or the location that they inputted. The special feature about this app is that it's dynamically styled. The weather app automatically picks a background image and color palette to match current weather condition. The app is fully optimized for mobile, tablet and desktop.
